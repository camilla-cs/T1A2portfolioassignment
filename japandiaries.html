            Since I was 14 years old I always dreamt of going to Japan. My passion from Japan steamed from an italian youtuber making a vlog about visiting this country and I remember falling in love with the sights I saw. <br>

        <p>I visited LOTS of temples and shrines, especially in the Kyoto area. <br>
            I remeber being always hot and thirsty, it was end of August for a reason! 
            It took me few days to realize that I was living my dream and I was feeling emotional most of the time.

            The things I bought most were presents for my family like sweets, matcha, chopstick, a fan and a doll. 
            The food was amazing, especially the sushi, I recommend visiting Sushir≈ç when in Japan, it's cheap and the quality is better than most!
