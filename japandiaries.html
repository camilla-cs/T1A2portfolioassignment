            Since I was 14 years old I always dreamt of going to Japan. My passion from Japan steamed from an italian youtuber making a vlog about visiting this country and I remember falling in love with the sights I saw. <br>

            <img src="./IMAGES/japanpic2.jpg" alt="Kinkakuji Shrine" id="japanPic2">
            I visited LOTS of temples and shrines, especially in the Kyoto area. <br>
            My favourite was the Kinkakuji Shrine (the Golden Temple), the weather was perfect and seeing it in real life after studying it in book at university was mesmerizing. <br>
            I remeber being always hot and thirsty, it was end of August for a reason! 
            It took me few days to realize that I was living my dream and I was feeling emotional most of the time.

        <p>
            <img src="./IMAGES/japanpic3.jpg" alt="Nara" id="japanPic3"> <br><br>

            I wasn't intended to visit Nara, considering that I had only a 10 days trip, but I'm glad I made time to visit it considering that it was the best place I visited. <br>
            The parks are huge and a lot of deers roaming aroung, most of them were calm but you need to be careful around them. <br>
            The things I bought most were presents for my family like sweets and expensive matcha. 
            The food was amazing, especially the sushi, I recommend visiting Sushir≈ç when in Japan, it's cheap and the quality is good!<br>
