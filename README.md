## **Functionality and Features** 

The features and functionality of my website are: 
+ The website can be easily navigated by using the navigation bar at the top of the screen which will take the user through different pages of the website: 
+ **Home** Will take you directly to the homepage.
+ **About me** Personal presentation of myself, my hobbies and interests. 
+ **Work** In this page there's a button that will open a new tab with a mockup resume and at the end the user will find a navigation bar with icons as links for professional and personal accounts such as Github, Linkedin, Facebook and Instagram. 

+ **Contact** The user can find a way to contact me by email and phone number but also by submitting a message via form. 
+ **Blog** The blog page has four different contents that will take you to pages where I'm able to express my passion for travel, anime, manga, music and also a place where I can talk about my future projects. 


The color palette that was chosen is made of pastel colors, with a tint of red for capturing the user's attention on important sections of the website such as resume link and blogs.

## **Sitemap**

The most difficult part of developing this website was deciding how it would look like. I had a vague idea of the colors I was gonna use but I felt stuck on deciding the design so eventually I decided to take care of the different pages first, and leave the homepage for later. And that's what I did.

## **Styling** 
The color palette is not only inspired by an illustration I have in my room, but also from my Pinterest board regarding aesthetic home decor, in particular the use of soft colors and maximalism. 
The main objective I had in mind while developing the website was to create a portfolio that would represent me as a person, starting from the color palette, made of soft colors like pastel green and pink, with a touch of red to emphasize important sections such as the resumeâ€™s link and the blogs.
